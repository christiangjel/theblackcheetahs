    "description": "The Black Cheetahs Official site. The Black Cheetahs is the Berlin-based project of music producer and artist Sofia TK, pianist Jack Wendy and Christian Gjelstrup on the bass. Their music bears the imprint of southern garage rock combined with post-modern electronics: A deep doomish sound of slow bpm's and a dark bluesy feel with an edge. Their punk-hypnotic show and deep immersive sound is gaining them followers from the dark rock and experimental scenes alike. A cathodic soundtrack that recalls and celebrates the spirit of sex, drugs, and rock'n'roll from its dark side. Debut album Slow Doomed Fever out now.",
